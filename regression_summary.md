## Summary of combined DHS/CFSVA stunting analyses
* **Geography**
  * NW corner of country has significantly worse (high elevations)
* In 2010/2012, most of country was pretty similar, aside from Kigali.
* In 2014/2015, large gains were observed in the East and parts of the West, leading to a large gap in the high-elevation mid-Western section of the country. 
* **Education** good 
* esp. mothers
* more important in the E provinces? 
* **Wealth** good
* in 2012, virtually irrelevant at lowest 3 quintiles of wealth, but becomes important at high wealth.
* **Sanitation** good
* diarrhea bad (so sanitation? health knowledge/access?)
* in 2010, more of a predictor in DHS --> sanitation access becoming more equal across country?
* **Family planning** important
* number of children under 5 --> more likely to have stunted child
* crowding is negatively associated with stunting.
* birth order, birth gap significant
* **Intergenerational poverty** 
  * stunted/malnourished mother --> more likely to have stunted child
* **Healthcare access / connectivity**
  * isolation / lack of healthcare associated w/ higher stunting.
* **Diets**
  * somewhat associated with lower stunting; possibly driven by vitamin-A rich fruits and vegetables.
* Food security was a larger issue in 2015 compared to 2012, and seemed to have affected the poor more than the wealthy.

## Summary of CFSVA FCS regressions
* **Geography**
  * Kigali dominates; much, much higher FCS (driven by animal products)
* Urban areas better.
* Eastern half of country tends to be better than W.
* Northern Highland Beans & Wheat and W. Congo-Nile Tea Crest are worse than Kigali
* **Food insecurity** bad
* # months food shortage
  * poor coping methods
* **demographics** 
  * female-headed bad
* crowding bad
* occupation: skilled laboreres, agropastoralists, med/high income agriculuturalists better than low income agriculturalists
* **financial capital** good
* wealth index
* **ag assets** good
* gardens
* TLUs
* growing irish potatoes (proxy for ...?)
* land ownership > 1 ha (though minority of people)
* **human capital**
  * **education**: male and female
* **connectivity** good
* roads < 2 km
* hospital/health facility w/i 60 min.
