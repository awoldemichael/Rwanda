# Import in the raw data --------------------------------------------------
# Raw data is contained in three files:
# children's data: 'cfsva-2015-child-DB- annex.sav'
# household-level data:  'cfsva-2015-master-DB- annex.sav'
# women's data: 'cfsva-2015-mother-DB- annex.sav'

children_raw = read_sav(paste0(baseDir, 'cfsva-2015-child-DB- annex.sav'))

# Notes on data -----------------------------------------------------------

# stunting is based on 2006 WHO children's growth standards
# stunting was calculated by WFP in SPSS.

# select variables --------------------------------------------------------
# Majority of household explanatory variables will be pulled from the household-level data.
