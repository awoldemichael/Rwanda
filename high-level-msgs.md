# Intro
## 2 sentence intro: why do we care?  What's the overall point/context?
#### Why does our analysis matter to the Rwanda Mission?  
#### How can the results from our analysis influence future investment decisions or current assessements of the portfolio?
#### Outcomes are geographically hetergenous -- geography matters and should be explicity accounted for when making investment decisions.
* Crosssectoral nature of stunting-- affects all areas of Rwanda's portfolio.
* Flip-- start w/ fertility as basis of issue.

## High-level findings
1. Geography matters to malnutrition outcomes.
  * Patterns in malnutrition and fertility vary across administrative borders, livelihood zones, and elevation.  
  * Improvements in malnutrition between 2010 and 2014/2015 were not equal across the country.[East v. West]
  * The northwest corner of Rwanda has significantly higher malnutrition, [lower contraception use] even after accounting for commanalities across space.
  * Elevation was also found to be a substantial contributing factor to malnutrition outcomes.

2. Basic needs to prevent stunting are being met, but more work is needed.
  * Improved sanitation and water access increased markedly in the past five year (Table 3 of EICV2-4).
  * What can explain the differences in malnutrition outcomes in the Northwest Volcanic zone compared to the Lake Kivu Coffee Zone?
3. Fertility and Modern Contraceptive Use (geographic conclusion).
  * Education and age are strongly associated with MCU
  * Religion matters -- Protestant households are much less likely to use MCU relative to similar Catholic Households.
  * Wealth does not appear to influence the MCU decision
  * Households in Lake Kivu are less likely to use MCU relative to similar households in Central Plateau Cassava and Farming

## Background + motivation
* Though Rwanda has had dramatic economic growth in the past 25 years, chronic child malnutrition remains high across the country, affecting <mark>nearly 40% of children under 5</mark>. Why aren't economic improvements being translated as quickly to improvements in stunting?
* The total fertility rate &mdash; how many children a woman will have in her lifetime &mdash; has decreased from a peak of XX to <mark>4.2 children/woman</mark> on average. However, the fertility rate is leveling off rather than continuing to decrease, which will introduce strain on systems, especially since Rwanda is already the densest nation in Africa. What's responsible for the slow down?

# Stunting
* Stunting decreased markedly between 2010 and 2014. [sparklines]
* However, the changes varied substantially by geography. (example of stunting rates in the east compared to the west).

[dot plot change over time]

[2014 interpolated surface]

* The NW corner seems higher than the rest of the country. Is this due to simply livelihood differences, or are there inherent geographic characteristics that can exlpain this disparity? 

* We build statistical models to test these ideas.
  * **geography**: NW, altitude (connectivity/accessibility?)
  * **wealth and human capital**: wealth, education, intergenerational poverty / health of mother
  * **WASH**: diarrhea bad, basic WASH needs met in 2014 for more people (?)
  * **Family planning / kids**: crowding, children under 5 --> link to FP
  * **diet**: little bit important, esp. vitamin A-rich fruits/veggies.

  ## Sidebars
  * What is stunting?
  * Q. for Mission: what is it about the NW geography that makes it different?

# Connection to programming

## Analysis of health indicators
* What is USAID measuring that may influence stunting?

## Comparison to CHAIN locations
* Where do we work on nutrition/sanitation programming?
* Are we working in the right places?
* Will need to wait until data is in to fully analyze.
* link to CHAIN maps

# Food consumption
## Main stories
* HH (especially the poor) were more food instable in 2015.
* Is there a geographic story to food consumption?

---
# Fertility
Two sides to fertility: 1) desires to have more children (purely social) and 2) access to contraception (social + access + education).

Trends:

1) Education good for MCU and limiting pregnancy.
2) Wealth unimportant
3) Protestants have more babies than Catholics and are ~ 22.5% less likely to use MCU.
4) Urban/rural gap narrows in 2014/2015.
