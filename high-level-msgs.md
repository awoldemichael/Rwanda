# Intro
## 2 sentence intro: why do we care?  What's the overall point/context?

## High-level findings
1. Geography matters.
  * Patterns in malnutrition and fertility cross across administrative borders and livelihood zones.
  * Improvements in malnutrition between 2010 and 2014/2015 are not equal across the country.
  * The northwest corner of Rwanda has significantly higher malnutrition, [lower contraception use].

2. Basic needs to prevent stunting are being met, but more work is needed.
  * Improved sanitation and water access increased markedly in the past five years.
3. Fertility and Modern Contraceptive Use are virtually unaffected by wealth.


## Background + motivation
* Though Rwanda has had dramatic economic growth in the past 25 years, chronic child malnutrition remains high across the country, affecting <mark>nearly 40% of children under 5</mark>. Why aren't economic improvements being translated as quickly to improvements in stunting?
* The total fertility rate &mdash; how many children a woman will have in her lifetime &mdash; has decreased from a peak of XX to <mark>4.2 children/woman</mark> on average. However, the fertility rate is leveling off rather than continuing to decrease, which will introduce strain on systems, especially since Rwanda is already the densest nation in Africa. What's responsible for the slow down?

# Stunting
* Stunting decreased a lot between 2010 and 2014. [sparklines]
* However, the changes were not equal everywhere.

[dot plot change over time]

[2014 interpolated surface]

* The NW corner seems higher than the rest of the country. Is this because the people have different livelihoods, or is the geography leading to significant differences?
* We ran regressions to test
  * **geography**: NW, altitude (connectivity/accessibility?)
  * **wealth and human capital**: wealth, education, intergenerational poverty / health of mother
  * **WASH**: diarrhea bad, basic WASH needs met in 2014 for more people (?)
  * **Family planning / kids**: crowding, children under 5 --> link to FP
  * **diet**: little bit important, esp. vitamin A-rich fruits/veggies.

# Connection to programming

## Analysis of health indicators
* Which of the things USAID is measuring significantly impacts stunting?

## Comparison to CHAIN locations
* Where do we work on nutrition/sanitation programming?
* Are we working in the right places?
* Will need to wait until data is in to fully analyze.
* link to CHAIN maps

# Food consumption
## Main stories
* HH (especially the poor) were more food instable in 2015.

# Fertility
Two sides to fertility: 1) desires to have more children (purely social) and 2) access to contraception (social + access + education).

Trends:

1) Education good for MCU and limiting pregnancy.
2) Wealth unimportant
3) Protestants have more babies than Catholics and are ~ 22.5% less likely to use MCU.
4) Urban/rural gap narrows in 2014/2015.


## Sidebars
* What is stunting?
* Q. for Mission: what is it about the NW geography that makes it different?
